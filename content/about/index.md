# About Me

My name is Nadhif Ginola. I'm a Software Engineer with a keen interest in challenges pertaining to real-time rendering, GPUs, and time-critical low-level software.  

I currently work at Arm as a Graphics Software Engineer on [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) drivers for current and next-generation [Mali GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_(processor)).

Enthusiastic, open, and versatile, I am always eager to learn new technologies and topics from different domains.
This websites serves as a learning log of sorts, for me to refine and document my scribbles, and have some fun while doing so.
