summary: 'What could the very first blog post be yapping about?'

This Hugo framework for building a static website is pretty cool.  
No need to get bogged down in having too many knobs to turn.

Markdown for populating content seems pretty handy.  
I haven't used Markdown much, but thankfully [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) comes to the rescue!

Not to mention.. there are [emojis](https://gohugo.io/quick-reference/emojis/) :smiling_imp:  
What would a zoomer website be without emojis?? :scream:

Hugo offers some handy [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) too!  
One of 'em lets us embed YouTube videos trivially.

And another one lets us attach some info/metadata to an image in a compact manner.

How does code look like?
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("sojourner");
}

```

Well, that's it folks!  
All this yapping was just an excuse for me to try out some Markdown :sunglasses:  

Until next time. :face_in_clouds:
